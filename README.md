# Solving Snake using Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks

This is an implementation of genetic algorithms combined with neural networks also known as neuroevolution

The algorithm doesnt perform amazing and i think thats due to the fact that i always spawn snakes on random
environments so they are never memorizing. Further proof of this is there are snakes in training phase that
get to the 20 food levels but i think randomness of the environment is more realistic.
